MATLAB®Assignments
------------------

You must turn in your assignments at the end of each class period.

| DAY # | ASSIGNMENTS |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | A step-by-step walk through of the first assignment will help finishing this homework assignment on your own. This is the on-line version of the notes handed out in class. You need to turn in two graphs by the end of the first day of MATLAB® class period ([PDF]({{< baseurl >}}/resources/day1lecture))  {{< br >}}  {{< br >}}As detailed, these graphs include {{< br >}}{{< br >}} *   A one page printout of the MATLAB® output of the force to displacement matrix, the forces, and maximum weight a recent 2.007 machine could lift with air cylinders ([PDF]({{< baseurl >}}/resources/hw1a)){{< br >}}*   A graph solution to a second order forced single d.o.f. oscillator ([PDF]({{< baseurl >}}/resources/hw1b)) {{< br >}}{{< br >}}  |
| 2 | Problem Set 2 |
| 3 | An step-by-step tutorial to walk through the last MATLAB® assignment was also handed out as notes. Complete the tasks, and turn in the resulting two graphs by the end of the third day of your MATLAB® class periods ([PDF]({{< baseurl >}}/resources/day3lecture))  {{< br >}}  {{< br >}}The assignment is to create two graphs of a numerical o.d.e. solution {{< br >}}{{< br >}} *   A first order temperature cooling equation ([PDF]({{< baseurl >}}/resources/hw3a)){{< br >}}*   A second order single degree of freedom oscillator equation ([PDF]({{< baseurl >}}/resources/hw3b)) {{< br >}}{{< br >}}  

Note there is no lecture on MATLAB® Day 3, but rather you are to work on your own to solve Problem Set 3.
